# Diet Optimizer
See here for the actual tool:

Description:
My inspiration for this was that I was trying to cut some weight for the summer and could find decent general advice for my diet, but wasn't sure if I would be getting all the right vitamins and micronutrients. So I wanted to make sure.

Diet optimizer helps you design the perfect diet based on your macronutrient, micronutrient, and vitamin needs.

My results from using the diet that I designed with it:
Lost 11lbs in 10 weeks.
